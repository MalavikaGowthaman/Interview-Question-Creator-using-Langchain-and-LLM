Introduction \\nCongestive heart failure is the main root of dysfunction in anatomy.  It is affected by the \\nreduction/blockage of coronary arteries. Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) is the most common  type of \\nCongestive heart failure. Common signs of Heart attack are Chest pain, body discomfort, and breath \\nshortness. Common symptoms of Arrhythmia are fluttering feelings in the chest or in common we can \\nquote it as “Palpitation.” Whereas common symptom of Heart failure is Breath shortness, Fatigue, or \\nswelling on the Leg, feet, ankles, neck veins, or even in the abdomen. Other than these there are other \\nmedical conditions and life cycles that can make people at high risk for heart disease like, Diabetes, \\nObesity, an Unbalanced diet, Physical incapacity or inactivity, and excessive usage of alcohol. \\n \\nThe current method of using an angiogram to identify heart disea ses has few risks to be overruled. \\nThey include allergic reactions to the dye used to see the coronary arteries, bleeding at the site  where \\nthe catheter is placed, and the usage of dye can even cause damage to the kidney. So, we recommend \\nthe usage of non-invasive methods. Predicting heart disease is extremely critical. Because one error in \\nprediction can lead to the death of the person. If a patient has diseases such as kidney failure or diabetes, \\nthen they must experience a higher risk after an angiogram. Some of such risks are: \\n \\n• May be allergic to anesthesia and contrast dye. \\n \\nCVMLH 2023: Workshop on Computer Vision and Machine Learning for Healthcare, May 20 – 21, 2023, Chennai, India. \\nEMAIL: sreekumari.sreelesh@gmail.com (Sreekumari S) \\nORCID: 0000-0002-0207-4738 (Sreekumari S) \\n \\n©️  2023 Copyright for this paper by its authors. \\nUse permitted under Creative Commons License Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0).  \\n \\nCEUR Workshop Proceedings (CEUR-WS.org) \\n \\nCEUR\\nWorkshop\\nProceedings\\nceur-ws.org\\nISSN 1613-0073\"),\n",

All human beings do not possess higher pain tolerance. Those who are having low pain tolerance \\ncannot undergo an angiogram because of the high-risk factors. In such cases, we must use non-invasive \\nmethods to predict heart diseases. Heart diseases are of diverse types. They are: \\n \\n• Coronary Artery disease (CAD) \\n• Heart Arrhythmias \\n• Heart failure \\n• Heart valve disease \\n• Stroke etc. \\n \\nTo predict heart disease with the best accuracy prediction algorithm should be the  right one . \\nOtherwise, the prediction will go wrong which leads to the death of a person. Here, we have summarized \\nrecent activities in which we can find distinct predictive analytics. \\n \\nSince heart disease datasets are easily available online, data collection becomes remarkably simple. \\nThere is a lack of knowledge of data. That will be achieved after processing the data. This  should be \\nperformed by collecting the proper data after avoiding inappropriate data.  Then find out the missing \\ndata and remove all the duplicates. This step is called data preprocessing. After this split the dataset into \\ntwo such as the training set and testing set. Then apply different classification and regression algorithms \\nto predict whether a person has a chance of any heart  disease. From the accuracy, choose the best \\npredictive method.

Supervised Machine Learning Algorithms \\nIn supervised machine learning, training data is provided to the machine which works as a supervisor \\nthat teaches the machines to predict the output accurately. In this method, labeled  data is provided to \\ntrain the model and the model learns about distinct types of data. After the training process, the model \\nis evaluated based on test data which is a subset of the training set and then it starts predicting the output. \\nSupervised learning can again be divided into two.

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/Heart.pdf', 'page': 3}, page_content='74 \\n \\n. \\nFigure 2: Categories of Supervised Learning \\n2.1. Logistic Regression \\nIt is one of the most significant machine learning algorithms because it can provide probabilities and \\nclassify new data by using discrete and continuous datasets. The first step is to extract the dependent \\nand independent variables. Then splitting of the dataset and feature scaling is performed. The outcome \\nmust be of a categorical or discrete value. \\n2.2. K- nearest neighbor algorithm \\nThis supervised learning algorithm stores all the given data and based on the similarity it classifies \\na new data point. It is also known as the “Lazy- Learner Algorithm.” Because it acts on the dataset \\nduring classification instead of learning from the training dataset. It can be used for both Regression \\nand Classification. But typically used for Classification problems. It will be more effective if the training \\ndata is large. \\n2.3. Support Vector Machine \\nThis is a well-liked supervised learning algorithm. In this plot, each data is a point in n- dimension \\nspace with each value of feature being a particular  coordinate value. Then classification is performed \\nafter finding the hyper-plane which is also known as the best decision boundary. \\n2.4. Artificial Neural Network \\nIt is a special type of machine-learning algorithm that is used  to model the human brain. ANN is \\ncapable of learning from the data, and it provides results as classification or prediction such as neurons \\nin our nervous system  learning from past data. ANNs are non -linear statistical models that show \\ncomplex relationships between inputs and outputs. The three important layers are the input layer, hidden \\nlayers, and output layer. The hidden layer may be single or multiple. In this model, different parameters \\naffect the performance of the model. The output is dependent on this data. The input layer communicates \\nwith the hidden layer and the activated neurons will continue passing until it reaches the output layer. \\n2.5. Decision Trees \\nIt is a type of supervised machine learning algorithm, in which the data set is always split based on \\na defined constraint. Decision nodes and leaves are the two results that can be derived from the decision \\ntree. \\n'),\n",

Random Forest Classification (RFC):  \\nRFC is based on the concept of combo learning, which means a process of solving a complex \\nproblem to an improved and more accurate level of performance of the model by combining the \\nmultiple classifiers. \\n \\nSince this rev iew paper is about machine learning techniques, we have gone through different \\nmachine learning algorithms. There are ample methods used in heart disease prediction  other than \\nmachine learning. They are deep learning, Data mining, IoT tools, etc. \\n3. Literature Review \\n \\nE. K. Oikonomou et al.  [1], they have given a clear idea about Artificial intelligence,  Machine \\nlearning, big data, and different prediction methods like supervised and unsupervised  methods. CT \\n(Cardiac Computed Tomography) imaging is the best way to predict  Cardio Artery Disease (CAD), \\nwhich will mitigate the complexity of doctors to predict CAD by using images, and it will be helpful \\nfor the patients to identify the disease faster.  Predictions are performed using Regression analysis and \\nClassification methods. Regression analysis is performed on the image using  a deep neural network \\n(DNN) algorithm or Support vector machines or decision trees. They have given a good explanation of \\nRadiomics. For image processing, detection, and segmentation they have used CCTA (Coronary CT \\nAngiography) scans and Machine Learning (ML) Algorithms. They stated that it can predict many risks \\nwhich are not possible with humans. They concluded by explaining the limitations and stating that this \\nwork has offered a lot to the patients as well as doctors. \\n \\nLi Bin et al. [2] tried to establish a disease pre-alert model within the 3 Year gap for hypertension \\npatients. To achieve public data analysis through AI technologies  they have used spark data analysis \\nfor hypertension patients. Using data mining, unbalanced data is converted to usable form using the Z-\\nscore standard. Stroke, Heart failure, and Renal Failure symptoms viz. 3 group predictions ascertain the \\npre-alert risk warning using a data mining algorithm. AI technologies used in this model are Logistic \\nRegression ( LR), Support  Vector Machine (SVM), and Naive Bayes Algorithm ( NB). For feature \\nselection, they have used the Chi-Square test. In this, they have used three types of datasets. They are \\nStroke, Heart failure, and Renal Failure. But they perform classification on two datasets viz. Stroke and \\nHeart failure. The algorithms used were Naïve Bayes, SVM , and Logistic regression. The stroke data \\nset shows an accuracy of more than .75, while classification results on the heart failure dataset show an \\naccuracy of more than .85. Logistic regression is superior to Naïve Bayes and SVM. They have shown \\nthe Receiver Operating Characteristic curve as well (ROC). They have used SVM -RFE for feature \\nselection, which is not suitable for choosing the most suitable feature subset. For getting better results \\nneed to use a different algorithm for comparing and analyzing in the next research because SVM-RFE \\ncannot evaluate various feature selection algorithms. \\n \\nS Manish et al. [3] they have given a brief description of the technologies used for the study. They \\nhave stated that this is the first paper that uses Optimally Time-Frequency Concentrated (OTFC) even-\\nlength biorthogonal wavelet filter bank (BWFB) for automatically detecting CAD. The Fuzzy Entropy \\n(FE) and log Energy (LogE) features were extracted from various subbands of the filter. They used Raw \\nECG data from twenty males and twenty females and CAD ECG from Six females and one male. Then \\nsignals were classified using Gaussian Support Machine Classifier (GSVM). They have stated that this \\nstudy shows high accuracy compared with other methods and while others are using thirty features for \\nclassification, they use only twelve features. \\n \\nA Moloud et al.  [4] proposed a data mining method for CAD analysis.  Data manipulation and \\nnormalization were performed first. Then they selected features using GA and PSO algorithms. 10-fold \\ncross-validation was performed on subsets. For classification purposes in the prelims test, they used ten '),\n",

They are nu-SVC, \\nnu-SVM, and Linear SVM. To optimize data, they used two optimization methods. Then they generated \\na confusion matrix for evaluating results. They have selected fitness functions. It has shown an accuracy \\nof 93.08% based on the confusion matrix. They concluded by saying that instead of normalization other \\npreprocessing approaches should be used in the future. \\n \\nR Silvia et al. [5] The objective of this review article is to describe the contemporary state of artificial \\nintelligence in clinical practice. In this paper, they have explained very well about Artificial Intelligence \\nand different subfields of Artificial intelligence like Machine learning, and deep learning and their \\nsubfields. They have given proper descriptions of new emerging  communication and information \\ntechnologies like Mobile health and IOT. These are subfields  of E-health. And explained applications \\nin cardiovascular imaging as well. Echocardiography, Magnetic resonance Imaging, Cardiac computed \\ntomography, and Electrocardiography are different applications in Cardiovascular Imaging. \\n \\nJohnson et al. [6] have done a study about how AI and ML relate to statistics and why cardiology \\nneeds AI. They have explained in detail how to choose the best algorithm for feature selection. Through \\nthis paper , we can easily understand  different supervised Machine Learning algorithms used in \\nCardiovascular disease prediction like Logistic Regression, Regularized Regression, Tree-Based \\nmethods, Bootstrap, and Support Vector Machine. For explaining these they have given proper \\nexamples. In Unsupervised Machine learning, they have given a brief description of Neural networks \\nand Deep Learning methods. The two most common forms of DL are CNN and RNN and explained the \\nmajor disadvantage of deep learning. They have concluded by stating to use this study as a decision tool \\nfor medical practitioners. \\n \\nAcharya et al. [7] explained invasive and non-invasive techniques used in CAD detection. They have \\nused Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) Classifier for this purpose. Non-linear parameters are extracted \\nfrom echocardiography images. They have taken four hundred normal images of thirty normal subjects \\nand Four hundred CAD images of  thirty affected subjects. They have noticed the ischemic changes. \\nTwelve lead electrocardiogram images were checked for wall motion abnormality. The training set and \\ntest set are there. An expert physician can mark the image collected as belonging to a normal or CAD-\\naffected person. Then different classifiers are used to extract the features. A total of 559 features are \\nextracted from each  image. T -test was used for statisti cal analysis. If p<.01 or.05, the feature is \\nmeasured as very perceptive. A three-fold stratified cross-validation technique is used for developing \\nand testing the classifiers. In this , they have used six classifiers. They are DT, FS, GMM, RBPNN, \\nKNN, and NBC. Then the heart index is calculated which is a combination of nine distinctive features. \\nThe heat index for normal is 2.52± 0.07 and for CAD 2.86± 0.11.  They have stated that this can be \\ntransformed into software, can be implemented on any device,  and concluded that this shows  100% \\naccuracy. \\n \\nS E Golovenkin et al. [8] tried to improve prediction by using the voting method of three competing \\nsystems and by eliminating sparse data columns. In this study,  the prediction was performed using \\nMatlab2016 System, the Neural Network Toolbox module. In Artificial Neural Network, there was one \\ninput layer and two hidden layers. All layers are interconnected, and the output layer predicts the results. \\nThe voting method is used in this. The “Sliding- Window” method was used to increase the efficiency \\nof the learning process. Standard indicators  are Accuracy, Sensitivity , and specificity. They ha ve \\neliminated sparse set input data columns.  They have also stated that the use of 3 Neural Networks \\nincreases accuracy by 1.2%. \\n \\nBabaoglu et al.  [9] used Principle Component Analysis (PCA) which is a   method of identifying \\npatterns in data  and expressing them by highlighting differences and  similarities. They have taken a \\ndataset of 480 patients after excluding patients with some problems. They have used a Support Vector \\nMachine for classification and regression tasks.  The assessments are implem ented in Matlab 7.0 \\napplication using the LIBSVM package. The SVM method for twenty-three features shows less \\naccuracy. So, using the PCA method, features were reduced to eighteen. Then it shows an accuracy of \\n79.17%. They have concluded by stating that, P CA reduced dataset using the SVM method increases '),\n",

[10] tried to provide the recent adaptive image -based classification techniques. \\nThey have explained diverse types of heart diseases. They have compared the prediction methods used \\nin different studies. The first step is image registration which can be performed on a raw image database \\nand de-noising processing should be done. The feature is extracted from the image. They have used two \\ndifferent training models. They are Naive - Bayes Classification and SVM. They have concluded by \\nstating that SVM is more accurate than Naïve Bayes Classification. The database needs to be updated \\nwith more descriptions of patients. \\n \\nM M Ali et al. [11] used the Kaggle dataset. They have done a comparison study and developed their \\nexperimental model. They have applied six classification algorithms to compare the accuracy of the \\nbest performer and statistical variables by using a ten-fold cross-validation method. The six classifiers \\nwere KNN, Random Forest, Decision Tree, AdaboostM1(ABM1), Logistic Regression, and Multilayer \\nPerception (MLP). They have  listed the five most crucial features based on feature importance and \\ncorrelation value. In this study compared to other classifiers RF shows 100% accuracy. KNN and MLP \\nfailed to generate feature importance scores or coefficient values. But this method has one limitation,  \\nthis data model is not enough to address all the issues. \\n \\nYazdani A et al.  [12] used WARM (Weighted Associative Rule Mining) to predict  heart disease. \\nThey have compared the efficiency of earlier models that used the WARM method to predict heart \\ndisease. In this model , weights are assigned to identify the  best features mined. Feature values are \\nevaluated. For Eg: Feature values for sex are Male and Female. After that calculate the total weight for \\nthe feature. Then applied WARM using the Apriori algorithm. Of thirteen features, eight significant \\nfeatures were identified. Finally, the confidence score is generated. This model shows a 98% confidence \\nscore which is better than the earlier studies. \\n \\nSumit S et al. [ 13] proposed this study to create a deep learning neural network  heart disease \\nprediction model by using a new optimization technique called Talos Hyperparameter. They have used \\nUCI Heart Disease Dataset. They applied different learning algorithms like Logistic regression, KNN, \\nSVM, Naïve Bayes, and Hyperparameter optimization (Talos). Talos follows POD (Prepare, Optimize, \\nand Deploy) process workflow. Reporting and evaluation are the last process after POD. Talos method \\nshows an accuracy of 90.78% which is better compared to other learning methods. \\n     \\nBharati R et al. [14] conducted this study to compare the performance of both Machine learning as \\nwell as deep learning methods. They have considered a public dataset. In this , they compared both \\nmachine learning as well as deep learning methods.  In pre-processing the data, checked the distribution \\nof data, skewness of data, stats of normal distribution data, feature selection , and checking for \\nduplicates. after that proposed machine learning classifiers as well as deep learning classifiers. Then \\nthey evaluated the process and concluded by stating that dataset size need s to be increased and more \\noptimization and normalization techniques need to be used. \\n \\nIshaq A et al. [15] conducted this study for comparing different machine learning techniques to select \\nthe most suitable method for heart disease survival prediction. The dataset used was UCI Repository. \\nThen applied RF to employ feature ranking. Classified the data into training and testing sets. They \\napplied one oversampling method called SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) to deal \\nwith imbalanced data in medicine. Performance evaluation matrices were Accuracy, Precision, Recall, \\nand F-Score.  Among 9 classifiers, they got more accuracy for RF, and it was .8889. With SMOTE, it \\nshows 10% more accuracy. Extra Tree Classifier (ETC) shows an accuracy of .9262.  Here RF produces \\nConstant approximation, ETC produces multi-linear approximation. \\n \\nRajni Bhalla et al. [16] presents a detailed examination of the effectiveness and performance of both \\nproposed and existing methodologies for classification task. The study aims to compare and evaluate \\nthe advantages and limitations of different methodologies for collectin g and analyzing data for '),\n",

By conducting a comparative analysis, the paper provides valuable insights for \\nresearchers and practitioners seeking to optimize their methodologies for classification tasks and for \\ndata that is in a structured format. \\n \\nAbdel-Basset M et al. [17] proposed this study to develop an IoT model to detect and monitor heart \\nfailure-infected patients. Achieved from various wearable sensors. They used WBAN or medical sensor \\nnodes. The data extracted from WBAN convey are sent to the mobile application through Bluetooth or \\nZigBee and stored in the cloud server to store, process , and broadcast data. Then N- MCDM model is \\nused to determine the percentage of heart failure disease. If the patient has severe heart failure, then an \\nambulance will be sent to the patient and treatments will be started. This will provide the ratio of heart \\nfailure so that the clinicians can easily decide the type of treatment.  \\n \\nRajni Bhalla et al. [18] presents a novel ensemble -based machine learning mo del that combines \\nmultiple categorical datasets to enhance prediction accuracy. The proposed approach consists of three \\nmain components: dataset alignment, model training, and prediction aggregation. The dataset alignment \\nphase focuses on mapping categoric al variables across different datasets, ensuring consistency and \\ncompatibility. \\n \\nRajni Bhalla et al. [19] concludes by identifying the current research trends and challenges in \\nsentiment classification using hybrid ensemble -based approaches. It highlights the need for further \\ninvestigation into the combination of diverse classifiers and the integration of deep learning techniques \\nin ensemble frameworks.  The hybrid ensemble approach can be applied to classification dataset like \\nheart disease detection to achieve better accuracy. \\n \\nSivagowry S et al. [20] created a review of the application of data mining in heart disease prediction. \\nIn this, they have compared different data mining algorithms and concluded like heart disease prediction \\nwith data mining will become most successful with a smaller number of attributes, and text mining the \\nmedical data needs to be extended in predicting the health care data. \\n4.

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/Heart.pdf', 'page': 8}, page_content='79 \\n \\nData collection is the first step. Data can be collected in two ways such as Online data and real-time \\ndata. Then we have to remove noise, missing values, useless values and all. This step is called data \\npreprocessing. Most of the online datasets are already preprocessed. So, we can directly use it without \\npreprocessing. But for real -time data, preprocessing can be done in different ways such as by using \\nmachine learning, deep learning or data mining methods. After this step we will get the data in usable \\nformat. Now, need to split the dataset into Training and Testing set. We can split the dataset in such a \\nway that 70% for training the model and 30% for testing. First train the model with train set. Then select \\nthe most significant feature for improving the prediction accuracy. Now, give test set to the model. It \\nwill predict accordingly. There are different evaluation metrics for checking the efficiency of the model \\nsuch as Precision, Recall, F1-score, confusion matrix and ROC curves etc. (Fig-3 depicts the same). \\n5.

      "Figure 2: Categories of Supervised Learning \n",
      "2.1. Logistic Regression \n",
      "It is one of the most significant machine learning algorithms because it can provide probabilities and \n",
      "classify new data by using discrete and continuous datasets. The first step is to extract the dependent \n",
      "and independent variables. Then splitting of the dataset and feature scaling is performed. The outcome \n",
      "must be of a categorical or discrete value. \n",
      "2.2. K- nearest neighbor algorithm \n",
      "This supervised learning algorithm stores all the given data and based on the similarity it classifies \n",
      "a new data point. It is also known as the “Lazy- Learner Algorithm.” Because it acts on the dataset \n",
      "during classification instead of learning from the training dataset. It can be used for both Regression \n",
      "and Classification. But typically used for Classification problems. It will be more effective if the training \n",
      "data is large. \n",

      "This is a well-liked supervised learning algorithm. In this plot, each data is a point in n- dimension \n",

      "It is a special type of machine-learning algorithm that is used  to model the human brain. ANN is \n",
      "capable of learning from the data, and it provides results as classification or prediction such as neurons \n",
      "in our nervous system  learning from past data. ANNs are non -linear statistical models that show \n",
      "complex relationships between inputs and outputs. The three important layers are the input layer, hidden \n",
      "layers, and output layer. The hidden layer may be single or multiple. In this model, different parameters \n",
      "affect the performance of the model. The output is dependent on this data. The input layer communicates \n",
      "with the hidden layer and the activated neurons will continue passing until it reaches the output layer. \n",
      "2.5. Decision Trees \n",
      "It is a type of supervised machine learning algorithm, in which the data set is always split based on \n",

This paper aims \\nto explore various machine learning techniques utilized in heart disease prediction, supporting \\nthe medical field in expedient diagnosis. The availability of vast amounts of patient information \\nonline presents an opportunity for effective utilization.

Introduction \\nCongestive heart failure is the main root of dysfunction in anatomy.  It is affected by the \\nreduction/blockage of coronary arteries. Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) is the most common  type of \\nCongestive heart failure. Common signs of Heart attack are Chest pain, body discomfort, and breath \\nshortness. Common symptoms of Arrhythmia are fluttering feelings in the chest or in common we can \\nquote it as “Palpitation.” Whereas common symptom of Heart failure is Breath shortness, Fatigue, or \\nswelling on the Leg, feet, ankles, neck veins, or even in the abdomen. Other than these there are other \\nmedical conditions and life cycles that can make people at high risk for heart disease like, Diabetes, \\nObesity, an Unbalanced diet, Physical incapacity or inactivity, and excessive usage of alcohol. \\n \\nThe current method of using an angiogram to identify heart disea ses has few risks to be overruled. \\nThey include allergic reactions to the dye used to see the coronary arteries, bleeding at the site  where \\nthe catheter is placed, and the usage of dye can even cause damage to the kidney. So, we recommend \\nthe usage of non-invasive methods. Predicting heart disease is extremely critical. Because one error in \\nprediction can lead to the death of the person. If a patient has diseases such as kidney failure or diabetes, \\nthen they must experience a higher risk after an angiogram. Some of such risks are: \\n \\n• May be allergic to anesthesia and contrast dye. \\n \\nCVMLH 2023: Workshop on Computer Vision and Machine Learning for Healthcare, May 20 – 21, 2023, Chennai, India. \\nEMAIL: sreekumari.sreelesh@gmail.com (Sreekumari S) \\nORCID: 0000-0002-0207-4738 (Sreekumari S) \\n \\n©️  2023 Copyright for this paper by its authors. \\nUse permitted under Creative Commons License Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0).  \\n \\nCEUR Workshop Proceedings (CEUR-WS.org) \\n \\nCEUR\\nWorkshop\\nProceedings\\nceur-ws.org\\nISSN 1613-007373 \\n \\n• Bleeding at the insertion point of the catheter. \\n• Blood clots or injury to an artery or vein. \\n \\nThese kinds of people must take contrast medicine before 24 hours to check whether they are allergic \\nor not.

All human beings do not possess higher pain tolerance. Those who are having low pain tolerance \\ncannot undergo an angiogram because of the high-risk factors. In such cases, we must use non-invasive \\nmethods to predict heart diseases. Heart diseases are of diverse types. They are: \\n \\n• Coronary Artery disease (CAD) \\n• Heart Arrhythmias \\n• Heart failure \\n• Heart valve disease \\n• Stroke etc. \\n \\nTo predict heart disease with the best accuracy prediction algorithm should be the  right one . \\nOtherwise, the prediction will go wrong which leads to the death of a person. Here, we have summarized \\nrecent activities in which we can find distinct predictive analytics. \\n \\nSince heart disease datasets are easily available online, data collection becomes remarkably simple. \\nThere is a lack of knowledge of data. That will be achieved after processing the data. This  should be \\nperformed by collecting the proper data after avoiding inappropriate data.  Then find out the missing \\ndata and remove all the duplicates. This step is called data preprocessing. After this split the dataset into \\ntwo such as the training set and testing set. Then apply different classification and regression algorithms \\nto predict whether a person has a chance of any heart  disease. From the accuracy, choose the best \\npredictive method. Fig-1 depicts the predictive method. \\n \\n \\nFigure 1: Predictive Model \\n2. Supervised Machine Learning Algorithms \\nIn supervised machine learning, training data is provided to the machine which works as a supervisor \\nthat teaches the machines to predict the output accurately. In this method, labeled  data is provided to \\ntrain the model and the model learns about distinct types of data. After the training process, the model \\nis evaluated based on test data which is a subset of the training set and then it starts predicting the output. \\nSupervised learning can again be divided into two. They are Regression and Classification. (Fig-2). The \\nfollowing are different machine learning   algorithms. \\n \\n74 \\n \\n. \\nFigure 2: Categories of Supervised Learning \\n2.1. Logistic Regression \\nIt is one of the most significant machine learning algorithms because it can provide probabilities and \\nclassify new data by using discrete and continuous datasets. The first step is to extract the dependent \\nand independent variables. Then splitting of the dataset and feature scaling is performed. The outcome \\nmust be of a categorical or discrete value. \\n2.2. K- nearest neighbor algorithm \\nThis supervised learning algorithm stores all the given data and based on the similarity it classifies \\na new data point. It is also known as the “Lazy- Learner Algorithm.” Because it acts on the dataset \\nduring classification instead of learning from the training dataset. It can be used for both Regression \\nand Classification. But typically used for Classification problems. It will be more effective if the training \\ndata is large. \\n2.3. Support Vector Machine \\nThis is a well-liked supervised learning algorithm. In this plot, each data is a point in n- dimension \\nspace with each value of feature being a particular  coordinate value. Then classification is performed \\nafter finding the hyper-plane which is also known as the best decision boundary. \\n2.4. Artificial Neural Network \\nIt is a special type of machine-learning algorithm that is used  to model the human brain. ANN is \\ncapable of learning from the data, and it provides results as classification or prediction such as neurons \\nin our nervous system  learning from past data. ANNs are non -linear statistical models that show \\ncomplex relationships between inputs and outputs. The three important layers are the input layer, hidden \\nlayers, and output layer. The hidden layer may be single or multiple. In this model, different parameters \\naffect the performance of the model. The output is dependent on this data. The input layer communicates \\nwith the hidden layer and the activated neurons will continue passing until it reaches the output layer. \\n2.5. Decision Trees \\nIt is a type of supervised machine learning algorithm, in which the data set is always split based on \\na defined constraint. Decision nodes and leaves are the two results that can be derived from the decision \\ntree. \\n75 \\n \\n2.6. Random Forest Classification (RFC):  \\nRFC is based on the concept of combo learning, which means a process of solving a complex \\nproblem to an improved and more accurate level of performance of the model by combining the \\nmultiple classifiers. \\n \\nSince this rev iew paper is about machine learning techniques, we have gone through different \\nmachine learning algorithms.',\n",

There are ample methods used in heart disease prediction  other than \\nmachine learning. They are deep learning, Data mining, IoT tools, etc. \\n3. Literature Review \\n \\nE. K. Oikonomou et al.  [1], they have given a clear idea about Artificial intelligence,  Machine \\nlearning, big data, and different prediction methods like supervised and unsupervised  methods. CT \\n(Cardiac Computed Tomography) imaging is the best way to predict  Cardio Artery Disease (CAD), \\nwhich will mitigate the complexity of doctors to predict CAD by using images, and it will be helpful \\nfor the patients to identify the disease faster.  Predictions are performed using Regression analysis and \\nClassification methods. Regression analysis is performed on the image using  a deep neural network \\n(DNN) algorithm or Support vector machines or decision trees. They have given a good explanation of \\nRadiomics. For image processing, detection, and segmentation they have used CCTA (Coronary CT \\nAngiography) scans and Machine Learning (ML) Algorithms. They stated that it can predict many risks \\nwhich are not possible with humans. They concluded by explaining the limitations and stating that this \\nwork has offered a lot to the patients as well as doctors. \\n \\nLi Bin et al. [2] tried to establish a disease pre-alert model within the 3 Year gap for hypertension \\npatients. To achieve public data analysis through AI technologies  they have used spark data analysis \\nfor hypertension patients. Using data mining, unbalanced data is converted to usable form using the Z-\\nscore standard. Stroke, Heart failure, and Renal Failure symptoms viz. 3 group predictions ascertain the \\npre-alert risk warning using a data mining algorithm. AI technologies used in this model are Logistic \\nRegression ( LR), Support  Vector Machine (SVM), and Naive Bayes Algorithm ( NB). For feature \\nselection, they have used the Chi-Square test. In this, they have used three types of datasets. They are \\nStroke, Heart failure, and Renal Failure. But they perform classification on two datasets viz. Stroke and \\nHeart failure. The algorithms used were Naïve Bayes, SVM , and Logistic regression. The stroke data \\nset shows an accuracy of more than .75, while classification results on the heart failure dataset show an \\naccuracy of more than .85. Logistic regression is superior to Naïve Bayes and SVM. They have shown \\nthe Receiver Operating Characteristic curve as well (ROC). They have used SVM -RFE for feature \\nselection, which is not suitable for choosing the most suitable feature subset. For getting better results \\nneed to use a different algorithm for comparing and analyzing in the next research because SVM-RFE \\ncannot evaluate various feature selection algorithms. \\n \\nS Manish et al. [3] they have given a brief description of the technologies used for the study. They \\nhave stated that this is the first paper that uses Optimally Time-Frequency Concentrated (OTFC) even-\\nlength biorthogonal wavelet filter bank (BWFB) for automatically detecting CAD. The Fuzzy Entropy \\n(FE) and log Energy (LogE) features were extracted from various subbands of the filter. They used Raw \\nECG data from twenty males and twenty females and CAD ECG from Six females and one male. Then \\nsignals were classified using Gaussian Support Machine Classifier (GSVM). They have stated that this \\nstudy shows high accuracy compared with other methods and while others are using thirty features for \\nclassification, they use only twelve features. \\n \\nA Moloud et al.  [4] proposed a data mining method for CAD analysis.  Data manipulation and \\nnormalization were performed first. Then they selected features using GA and PSO algorithms. 10-fold \\ncross-validation was performed on subsets. For classification purposes in the prelims test, they used ten 76 \\n \\nalgorithms. Among them, the best three SVM classifiers were selected for the final. They are nu-SVC, \\nnu-SVM, and Linear SVM. To optimize data, they used two optimization methods. Then they generated \\na confusion matrix for evaluating results. They have selected fitness functions. It has shown an accuracy \\nof 93.08% based on the confusion matrix. They concluded by saying that instead of normalization other \\npreprocessing approaches should be used in the future. \\n \\nR Silvia et al',\n",

[5] The objective of this review article is to describe the contemporary state of artificial \\nintelligence in clinical practice. In this paper, they have explained very well about Artificial Intelligence \\nand different subfields of Artificial intelligence like Machine learning, and deep learning and their \\nsubfields. They have given proper descriptions of new emerging  communication and information \\ntechnologies like Mobile health and IOT. These are subfields  of E-health. And explained applications \\nin cardiovascular imaging as well. Echocardiography, Magnetic resonance Imaging, Cardiac computed \\ntomography, and Electrocardiography are different applications in Cardiovascular Imaging. \\n \\nJohnson et al. [6] have done a study about how AI and ML relate to statistics and why cardiology \\nneeds AI. They have explained in detail how to choose the best algorithm for feature selection. Through \\nthis paper , we can easily understand  different supervised Machine Learning algorithms used in \\nCardiovascular disease prediction like Logistic Regression, Regularized Regression, Tree-Based \\nmethods, Bootstrap, and Support Vector Machine. For explaining these they have given proper \\nexamples. In Unsupervised Machine learning, they have given a brief description of Neural networks \\nand Deep Learning methods. The two most common forms of DL are CNN and RNN and explained the \\nmajor disadvantage of deep learning. They have concluded by stating to use this study as a decision tool \\nfor medical practitioners. \\n \\nAcharya et al. [7] explained invasive and non-invasive techniques used in CAD detection. They have \\nused Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) Classifier for this purpose. Non-linear parameters are extracted \\nfrom echocardiography images. They have taken four hundred normal images of thirty normal subjects \\nand Four hundred CAD images of  thirty affected subjects. They have noticed the ischemic changes. \\nTwelve lead electrocardiogram images were checked for wall motion abnormality. The training set and \\ntest set are there. An expert physician can mark the image collected as belonging to a normal or CAD-\\naffected person. Then different classifiers are used to extract the features. A total of 559 features are \\nextracted from each  image. T -test was used for statisti cal analysis. If p<.01 or.05, the feature is \\nmeasured as very perceptive. A three-fold stratified cross-validation technique is used for developing \\nand testing the classifiers. In this , they have used six classifiers. They are DT, FS, GMM, RBPNN, \\nKNN, and NBC. Then the heart index is calculated which is a combination of nine distinctive features. \\nThe heat index for normal is 2.52± 0.07 and for CAD 2.86± 0.11.  They have stated that this can be \\ntransformed into software, can be implemented on any device,  and concluded that this shows  100% \\naccuracy. \\n \\nS E Golovenkin et al. [8] tried to improve prediction by using the voting method of three competing \\nsystems and by eliminating sparse data columns. In this study,  the prediction was performed using \\nMatlab2016 System, the Neural Network Toolbox module. In Artificial Neural Network, there was one \\ninput layer and two hidden layers. All layers are interconnected, and the output layer predicts the results. \\nThe voting method is used in this. The “Sliding- Window” method was used to increase the efficiency \\nof the learning process. Standard indicators  are Accuracy, Sensitivity , and specificity. They ha ve \\neliminated sparse set input data columns.  They have also stated that the use of 3 Neural Networks \\nincreases accuracy by 1.2%. \\n \\nBabaoglu et al.  [9] used Principle Component Analysis (PCA) which is a   method of identifying \\npatterns in data  and expressing them by highlighting differences and  similarities. They have taken a \\ndataset of 480 patients after excluding patients with some problems. They have used a Support Vector \\nMachine for classification and regression tasks.  The assessments are implem ented in Matlab 7.0 \\napplication using the LIBSVM package. The SVM method for twenty-three features shows less \\naccuracy. So, using the PCA method, features were reduced to eighteen. Then it shows an accuracy of \\n79.17%. They have concluded by stating that, P CA reduced dataset',\n",

[10] tried to provide the recent adaptive image -based classification techniques. \\nThey have explained diverse types of heart diseases. They have compared the prediction methods used \\nin different studies. The first step is image registration which can be performed on a raw image database \\nand de-noising processing should be done. The feature is extracted from the image. They have used two \\ndifferent training models. They are Naive - Bayes Classification and SVM. They have concluded by \\nstating that SVM is more accurate than Naïve Bayes Classification. The database needs to be updated \\nwith more descriptions of patients. \\n \\nM M Ali et al. [11] used the Kaggle dataset. They have done a comparison study and developed their \\nexperimental model. They have applied six classification algorithms to compare the accuracy of the \\nbest performer and statistical variables by using a ten-fold cross-validation method. The six classifiers \\nwere KNN, Random Forest, Decision Tree, AdaboostM1(ABM1), Logistic Regression, and Multilayer \\nPerception (MLP). They have  listed the five most crucial features based on feature importance and \\ncorrelation value. In this study compared to other classifiers RF shows 100% accuracy. KNN and MLP \\nfailed to generate feature importance scores or coefficient values. But this method has one limitation,  \\nthis data model is not enough to address all the issues. \\n \\nYazdani A et al.  [12] used WARM (Weighted Associative Rule Mining) to predict  heart disease. \\nThey have compared the efficiency of earlier models that used the WARM method to predict heart \\ndisease. In this model , weights are assigned to identify the  best features mined. Feature values are \\nevaluated. For Eg: Feature values for sex are Male and Female. After that calculate the total weight for \\nthe feature. Then applied WARM using the Apriori algorithm. Of thirteen features, eight significant \\nfeatures were identified. Finally, the confidence score is generated. This model shows a 98% confidence \\nscore which is better than the earlier studies. \\n \\nSumit S et al. [ 13] proposed this study to create a deep learning neural network  heart disease \\nprediction model by using a new optimization technique called Talos Hyperparameter. They have used \\nUCI Heart Disease Dataset. They applied different learning algorithms like Logistic regression, KNN, \\nSVM, Naïve Bayes, and Hyperparameter optimization (Talos). Talos follows POD (Prepare, Optimize, \\nand Deploy) process workflow. Reporting and evaluation are the last process after POD. Talos method \\nshows an accuracy of 90.78% which is better compared to other learning methods. \\n     \\nBharati R et al. [14] conducted this study to compare the performance of both Machine learning as \\nwell as deep learning methods. They have considered a public dataset. In this , they compared both \\nmachine learning as well as deep learning methods.  In pre-processing the data, checked the distribution \\nof data, skewness of data, stats of normal distribution data, feature selection , and checking for \\nduplicates. after that proposed machine learning classifiers as well as deep learning classifiers. Then \\nthey evaluated the process and concluded by stating that dataset size need s to be increased and more \\noptimization and normalization techniques need to be used. \\n \\nIshaq A et al. [15] conducted this study for comparing different machine learning techniques to select \\nthe most suitable method for heart disease survival prediction. The dataset used was UCI Repository. \\nThen applied RF to employ feature ranking. Classified the data into training and testing sets. They \\napplied one oversampling method called SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) to deal \\nwith imbalanced data in medicine. Performance evaluation matrices were Accuracy, Precision, Recall, \\nand F-Score.  Among 9 classifiers, they got more accuracy for RF, and it was .8889. With SMOTE, it \\nshows 10% more accuracy. Extra Tree Classifier (ETC) shows an accuracy of .9262.  Here',\n",

[16] presents a detailed examination of the effectiveness and performance of both \\nproposed and existing methodologies for classification task. The study aims to compare and evaluate \\nthe advantages and limitations of different methodologies for collectin g and analyzing data for 78 \\n \\nstructured data. By conducting a comparative analysis, the paper provides valuable insights for \\nresearchers and practitioners seeking to optimize their methodologies for classification tasks and for \\ndata that is in a structured format. \\n \\nAbdel-Basset M et al. [17] proposed this study to develop an IoT model to detect and monitor heart \\nfailure-infected patients. Achieved from various wearable sensors. They used WBAN or medical sensor \\nnodes. The data extracted from WBAN convey are sent to the mobile application through Bluetooth or \\nZigBee and stored in the cloud server to store, process , and broadcast data. Then N- MCDM model is \\nused to determine the percentage of heart failure disease. If the patient has severe heart failure, then an \\nambulance will be sent to the patient and treatments will be started. This will provide the ratio of heart \\nfailure so that the clinicians can easily decide the type of treatment.  \\n \\nRajni Bhalla et al. [18] presents a novel ensemble -based machine learning mo del that combines \\nmultiple categorical datasets to enhance prediction accuracy. The proposed approach consists of three \\nmain components: dataset alignment, model training, and prediction aggregation. The dataset alignment \\nphase focuses on mapping categoric al variables across different datasets, ensuring consistency and \\ncompatibility. \\n \\nRajni Bhalla et al. [19] concludes by identifying the current research trends and challenges in \\nsentiment classification using hybrid ensemble -based approaches. It highlights the need for further \\ninvestigation into the combination of diverse classifiers and the integration of deep learning techniques \\nin ensemble frameworks.  The hybrid ensemble approach can be applied to classification dataset like \\nheart disease detection to achieve better accuracy. \\n \\nSivagowry S et al. [20] created a review of the application of data mining in heart disease prediction. \\nIn this, they have compared different data mining algorithms and concluded like heart disease prediction \\nwith data mining will become most successful with a smaller number of attributes, and text mining the \\nmedical data needs to be extended in predicting the health care data. \\n4. Methodology  \\n \\nFigure 3: Methodology \\n79 \\n \\nData collection is the first step. Data can be collected in two ways such as Online data and real-time \\ndata. Then we have to remove noise, missing values, useless values and all. This step is called data \\npreprocessing. Most of the online datasets are already preprocessed. So, we can directly use it without \\npreprocessing. But for real -time data, preprocessing can be done in different ways such as by using \\nmachine learning, deep learning or data mining methods. After this step we will get the data in usable \\nformat. Now, need to split the dataset into Training and Testing set. We can split the dataset in such a \\nway that 70% for training the model and 30% for testing. First train the model with train set. Then select \\nthe most significant feature for improving the prediction accuracy. Now, give test set to the model. It \\nwill predict accordingly. There are different evaluation metrics for checking the efficiency of the model \\nsuch as Precision, Recall, F1-score, confusion matrix and ROC curves etc. (Fig-3 depicts the same). \\n5. Results \\nThere are different regression and classification algorithms used to predict heart disease.  Different \\nmethods are used in different papers, and they have shown the accuracy that they obtained while using \\ndifferent methods. Table 1 shows the comparison of different works.

Introduction \\nCongestive heart failure is the main root of dysfunction in anatomy.  It is affected by the \\nreduction/blockage of coronary arteries. Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) is the most common  type of \\nCongestive heart failure. Common signs of Heart attack are Chest pain, body discomfort, and breath \\nshortness. Common symptoms of Arrhythmia are fluttering feelings in the chest or in common we can \\nquote it as “Palpitation.” Whereas common symptom of Heart failure is Breath shortness, Fatigue, or \\nswelling on the Leg, feet, ankles, neck veins, or even in the abdomen. Other than these there are other \\nmedical conditions and life cycles that can make people at high risk for heart disease like, Diabetes, \\nObesity, an Unbalanced diet, Physical incapacity or inactivity, and excessive usage of alcohol. \\n \\nThe current method of using an angiogram to identify heart disea ses has few risks to be overruled. \\nThey include allergic reactions to the dye used to see the coronary arteries, bleeding at the site  where \\nthe catheter is placed, and the usage of dye can even cause damage to the kidney. So, we recommend \\nthe usage of non-invasive methods. Predicting heart disease is extremely critical. Because one error in \\nprediction can lead to the death of the person. If a patient has diseases such as kidney failure or diabetes, \\nthen they must experience a higher risk after an angiogram. Some of such risks are: \\n \\n• May be allergic to anesthesia and contrast dye. \\n \\nCVMLH 2023: Workshop on Computer Vision and Machine Learning for Healthcare, May 20 – 21, 2023, Chennai, India. \\nEMAIL: sreekumari.sreelesh@gmail.com (Sreekumari S) \\nORCID: 0000-0002-0207-4738 (Sreekumari S) \\n \\n©️  2023 Copyright for this paper by its authors. \\nUse permitted under Creative Commons License Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0).  \\n \\nCEUR Workshop Proceedings (CEUR-WS.org) \\n \\nCEUR\\nWorkshop\\nProceedings\\nceur-ws.org\\nISSN 1613-007373 \\n \\n• Bleeding at the insertion point of the catheter. \\n• Blood clots or injury to an artery or vein. \\n \\nThese kinds of people must take contrast medicine before 24 hours to check whether they are allergic \\nor not.

All human beings do not possess higher pain tolerance. Those who are having low pain tolerance \\ncannot undergo an angiogram because of the high-risk factors. In such cases, we must use non-invasive \\nmethods to predict heart diseases. Heart diseases are of diverse types. They are: \\n \\n• Coronary Artery disease (CAD) \\n• Heart Arrhythmias \\n• Heart failure \\n• Heart valve disease \\n• Stroke etc. \\n \\nTo predict heart disease with the best accuracy prediction algorithm should be the  right one . \\nOtherwise, the prediction will go wrong which leads to the death of a person. Here, we have summarized \\nrecent activities in which we can find distinct predictive analytics. \\n \\nSince heart disease datasets are easily available online, data collection becomes remarkably simple. \\nThere is a lack of knowledge of data. That will be achieved after processing the data. This  should be \\nperformed by collecting the proper data after avoiding inappropriate data.  Then find out the missing \\ndata and remove all the duplicates. This step is called data preprocessing. After this split the dataset into \\ntwo such as the training set and testing set. Then apply different classification and regression algorithms \\nto predict whether a person has a chance of any heart  disease. From the accuracy, choose the best \\npredictive method. Fig-1 depicts the predictive method. \\n \\n \\nFigure 1: Predictive Model \\n2. Supervised Machine Learning Algorithms \\nIn supervised machine learning, training data is provided to the machine which works as a supervisor \\nthat teaches the machines to predict the output accurately. In this method, labeled  data is provided to \\ntrain the model and the model learns about distinct types of data. After the training process, the model \\nis evaluated based on test data which is a subset of the training set and then it starts predicting the output. \\nSupervised learning can again be divided into two. They are Regression and Classification. (Fig-2). The \\nfollowing are different machine learning   algorithms. \\n \\n74 \\n \\n. \\nFigure 2: Categories of Supervised Learning \\n2.1. Logistic Regression \\nIt is one of the most significant machine learning algorithms because it can provide probabilities and \\nclassify new data by using discrete and continuous datasets. The first step is to extract the dependent \\nand independent variables. Then splitting of the dataset and feature scaling is performed. The outcome \\nmust be of a categorical or discrete value. \\n2.2. K- nearest neighbor algorithm \\nThis supervised learning algorithm stores all the given data and based on the similarity it classifies \\na new data point. It is also known as the “Lazy- Learner Algorithm.” Because it acts on the dataset \\nduring classification instead of learning from the training dataset. It can be used for both Regression \\nand Classification. But typically used for Classification problems. It will be more effective if the training \\ndata is large. \\n2.3. Support Vector Machine \\nThis is a well-liked supervised learning algorithm. In this plot, each data is a point in n- dimension \\nspace with each value of feature being a particular  coordinate value. Then classification is performed \\nafter finding the hyper-plane which is also known as the best decision boundary. \\n2.4. Artificial Neural Network \\nIt is a special type of machine-learning algorithm that is used  to model the human brain. ANN is \\ncapable of learning from the data, and it provides results as classification or prediction such as neurons \\nin our nervous system  learning from past data. ANNs are non -linear statistical models that show \\ncomplex relationships between inputs and outputs. The three important layers are the input layer, hidden \\nlayers, and output layer. The hidden layer may be single or multiple. In this model, different parameters \\naffect the performance of the model. The output is dependent on this data. The input layer communicates \\nwith the hidden layer and the activated neurons will continue passing until it reaches the output layer. \\n2.5. Decision Trees \\nIt is a type of supervised machine learning algorithm, in which the data set is always split based on \\na defined constraint. Decision nodes and leaves are the two results that can be derived from the decision \\ntree. \\n75 \\n \\n2.6. Random Forest Classification (RFC):  \\nRFC is based on the concept of combo learning, which means a process of solving a complex \\nproblem to an improved and more accurate level of performance of the model by combining the \\nmultiple classifiers. \\n \\nSince this rev iew paper is about machine learning techniques, we have gone through different \\nmachine learning algorithms.'),\n",

There are ample methods used in heart disease prediction  other than \\nmachine learning. They are deep learning, Data mining, IoT tools, etc. \\n3. Literature Review \\n \\nE. K. Oikonomou et al.  [1], they have given a clear idea about Artificial intelligence,  Machine \\nlearning, big data, and different prediction methods like supervised and unsupervised  methods. CT \\n(Cardiac Computed Tomography) imaging is the best way to predict  Cardio Artery Disease (CAD), \\nwhich will mitigate the complexity of doctors to predict CAD by using images, and it will be helpful \\nfor the patients to identify the disease faster.  Predictions are performed using Regression analysis and \\nClassification methods. Regression analysis is performed on the image using  a deep neural network \\n(DNN) algorithm or Support vector machines or decision trees. They have given a good explanation of \\nRadiomics. For image processing, detection, and segmentation they have used CCTA (Coronary CT \\nAngiography) scans and Machine Learning (ML) Algorithms. They stated that it can predict many risks \\nwhich are not possible with humans. They concluded by explaining the limitations and stating that this \\nwork has offered a lot to the patients as well as doctors. \\n \\nLi Bin et al. [2] tried to establish a disease pre-alert model within the 3 Year gap for hypertension \\npatients. To achieve public data analysis through AI technologies  they have used spark data analysis \\nfor hypertension patients. Using data mining, unbalanced data is converted to usable form using the Z-\\nscore standard. Stroke, Heart failure, and Renal Failure symptoms viz. 3 group predictions ascertain the \\npre-alert risk warning using a data mining algorithm. AI technologies used in this model are Logistic \\nRegression ( LR), Support  Vector Machine (SVM), and Naive Bayes Algorithm ( NB). For feature \\nselection, they have used the Chi-Square test. In this, they have used three types of datasets. They are \\nStroke, Heart failure, and Renal Failure. But they perform classification on two datasets viz. Stroke and \\nHeart failure. The algorithms used were Naïve Bayes, SVM , and Logistic regression. The stroke data \\nset shows an accuracy of more than .75, while classification results on the heart failure dataset show an \\naccuracy of more than .85. Logistic regression is superior to Naïve Bayes and SVM. They have shown \\nthe Receiver Operating Characteristic curve as well (ROC). They have used SVM -RFE for feature \\nselection, which is not suitable for choosing the most suitable feature subset. For getting better results \\nneed to use a different algorithm for comparing and analyzing in the next research because SVM-RFE \\ncannot evaluate various feature selection algorithms. \\n \\nS Manish et al. [3] they have given a brief description of the technologies used for the study. They \\nhave stated that this is the first paper that uses Optimally Time-Frequency Concentrated (OTFC) even-\\nlength biorthogonal wavelet filter bank (BWFB) for automatically detecting CAD. The Fuzzy Entropy \\n(FE) and log Energy (LogE) features were extracted from various subbands of the filter. They used Raw \\nECG data from twenty males and twenty females and CAD ECG from Six females and one male. Then \\nsignals were classified using Gaussian Support Machine Classifier (GSVM). They have stated that this \\nstudy shows high accuracy compared with other methods and while others are using thirty features for \\nclassification, they use only twelve features. \\n \\nA Moloud et al.  [4] proposed a data mining method for CAD analysis.  Data manipulation and \\nnormalization were performed first. Then they selected features using GA and PSO algorithms. 10-fold \\ncross-validation was performed on subsets. For classification purposes in the prelims test, they used ten 76 \\n \\nalgorithms. Among them, the best three SVM classifiers were selected for the final. They are nu-SVC, \\nnu-SVM, and Linear SVM. To optimize data, they used two optimization methods. Then they generated \\na confusion matrix for evaluating results. They have selected fitness functions. It has shown an accuracy \\nof 93.08% based on the confusion matrix. They concluded by saying that instead of normalization other \\npreprocessing approaches should be used in the future. \\n \\nR Silvia et al'),\n",

[5] The objective of this review article is to describe the contemporary state of artificial \\nintelligence in clinical practice. In this paper, they have explained very well about Artificial Intelligence \\nand different subfields of Artificial intelligence like Machine learning, and deep learning and their \\nsubfields. They have given proper descriptions of new emerging  communication and information \\ntechnologies like Mobile health and IOT. These are subfields  of E-health. And explained applications \\nin cardiovascular imaging as well. Echocardiography, Magnetic resonance Imaging, Cardiac computed \\ntomography, and Electrocardiography are different applications in Cardiovascular Imaging. \\n \\nJohnson et al. [6] have done a study about how AI and ML relate to statistics and why cardiology \\nneeds AI. They have explained in detail how to choose the best algorithm for feature selection. Through \\nthis paper , we can easily understand  different supervised Machine Learning algorithms used in \\nCardiovascular disease prediction like Logistic Regression, Regularized Regression, Tree-Based \\nmethods, Bootstrap, and Support Vector Machine. For explaining these they have given proper \\nexamples. In Unsupervised Machine learning, they have given a brief description of Neural networks \\nand Deep Learning methods. The two most common forms of DL are CNN and RNN and explained the \\nmajor disadvantage of deep learning. They have concluded by stating to use this study as a decision tool \\nfor medical practitioners. \\n \\nAcharya et al. [7] explained invasive and non-invasive techniques used in CAD detection. They have \\nused Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) Classifier for this purpose. Non-linear parameters are extracted \\nfrom echocardiography images. They have taken four hundred normal images of thirty normal subjects \\nand Four hundred CAD images of  thirty affected subjects. They have noticed the ischemic changes. \\nTwelve lead electrocardiogram images were checked for wall motion abnormality. The training set and \\ntest set are there. An expert physician can mark the image collected as belonging to a normal or CAD-\\naffected person. Then different classifiers are used to extract the features. A total of 559 features are \\nextracted from each  image. T -test was used for statisti cal analysis. If p<.01 or.05, the feature is \\nmeasured as very perceptive. A three-fold stratified cross-validation technique is used for developing \\nand testing the classifiers. In this , they have used six classifiers. They are DT, FS, GMM, RBPNN, \\nKNN, and NBC. Then the heart index is calculated which is a combination of nine distinctive features. \\nThe heat index for normal is 2.52± 0.07 and for CAD 2.86± 0.11.  They have stated that this can be \\ntransformed into software, can be implemented on any device,  and concluded that this shows  100% \\naccuracy. \\n \\nS E Golovenkin et al. [8] tried to improve prediction by using the voting method of three competing \\nsystems and by eliminating sparse data columns. In this study,  the prediction was performed using \\nMatlab2016 System, the Neural Network Toolbox module. In Artificial Neural Network, there was one \\ninput layer and two hidden layers. All layers are interconnected, and the output layer predicts the results. \\nThe voting method is used in this. The “Sliding- Window” method was used to increase the efficiency \\nof the learning process. Standard indicators  are Accuracy, Sensitivity , and specificity. They ha ve \\neliminated sparse set input data columns.  They have also stated that the use of 3 Neural Networks \\nincreases accuracy by 1.2%. \\n \\nBabaoglu et al.  [9] used Principle Component Analysis (PCA) which is a   method of identifying \\npatterns in data  and expressing them by highlighting differences and  similarities. They have taken a \\ndataset of 480 patients after excluding patients with some problems. They have used a Support Vector \\nMachine for classification and regression tasks.  The assessments are implem ented in Matlab 7.0 \\napplication using the LIBSVM package. The SVM method for twenty-three features shows less \\naccuracy.

[10] tried to provide the recent adaptive image -based classification techniques. \\nThey have explained diverse types of heart diseases. They have compared the prediction methods used \\nin different studies. The first step is image registration which can be performed on a raw image database \\nand de-noising processing should be done. The feature is extracted from the image. They have used two \\ndifferent training models. They are Naive - Bayes Classification and SVM. They have concluded by \\nstating that SVM is more accurate than Naïve Bayes Classification. The database needs to be updated \\nwith more descriptions of patients. \\n \\nM M Ali et al. [11] used the Kaggle dataset. They have done a comparison study and developed their \\nexperimental model. They have applied six classification algorithms to compare the accuracy of the \\nbest performer and statistical variables by using a ten-fold cross-validation method. The six classifiers \\nwere KNN, Random Forest, Decision Tree, AdaboostM1(ABM1), Logistic Regression, and Multilayer \\nPerception (MLP). They have  listed the five most crucial features based on feature importance and \\ncorrelation value. In this study compared to other classifiers RF shows 100% accuracy. KNN and MLP \\nfailed to generate feature importance scores or coefficient values. But this method has one limitation,  \\nthis data model is not enough to address all the issues. \\n \\nYazdani A et al.  [12] used WARM (Weighted Associative Rule Mining) to predict  heart disease. \\nThey have compared the efficiency of earlier models that used the WARM method to predict heart \\ndisease. In this model , weights are assigned to identify the  best features mined. Feature values are \\nevaluated. For Eg: Feature values for sex are Male and Female. After that calculate the total weight for \\nthe feature. Then applied WARM using the Apriori algorithm. Of thirteen features, eight significant \\nfeatures were identified. Finally, the confidence score is generated. This model shows a 98% confidence \\nscore which is better than the earlier studies. \\n \\nSumit S et al. [ 13] proposed this study to create a deep learning neural network  heart disease \\nprediction model by using a new optimization technique called Talos Hyperparameter. They have used \\nUCI Heart Disease Dataset. They applied different learning algorithms like Logistic regression, KNN, \\nSVM, Naïve Bayes, and Hyperparameter optimization (Talos). Talos follows POD (Prepare, Optimize, \\nand Deploy) process workflow. Reporting and evaluation are the last process after POD. Talos method \\nshows an accuracy of 90.78% which is better compared to other learning methods. \\n     \\nBharati R et al. [14] conducted this study to compare the performance of both Machine learning as \\nwell as deep learning methods. They have considered a public dataset. In this , they compared both \\nmachine learning as well as deep learning methods.  In pre-processing the data, checked the distribution \\nof data, skewness of data, stats of normal distribution data, feature selection , and checking for \\nduplicates. after that proposed machine learning classifiers as well as deep learning classifiers. Then \\nthey evaluated the process and concluded by stating that dataset size need s to be increased and more \\noptimization and normalization techniques need to be used. \\n \\nIshaq A et al. [15] conducted this study for comparing different machine learning techniques to select \\nthe most suitable method for heart disease survival prediction. The dataset used was UCI Repository. \\nThen applied RF to employ feature ranking. Classified the data into training and testing sets. They \\napplied one oversampling method called SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) to deal \\nwith imbalanced data in medicine.

[16] presents a detailed examination of the effectiveness and performance of both \\nproposed and existing methodologies for classification task. The study aims to compare and evaluate \\nthe advantages and limitations of different methodologies for collectin g and analyzing data for 78 \\n \\nstructured data. By conducting a comparative analysis, the paper provides valuable insights for \\nresearchers and practitioners seeking to optimize their methodologies for classification tasks and for \\ndata that is in a structured format. \\n \\nAbdel-Basset M et al. [17] proposed this study to develop an IoT model to detect and monitor heart \\nfailure-infected patients. Achieved from various wearable sensors. They used WBAN or medical sensor \\nnodes. The data extracted from WBAN convey are sent to the mobile application through Bluetooth or \\nZigBee and stored in the cloud server to store, process , and broadcast data. Then N- MCDM model is \\nused to determine the percentage of heart failure disease. If the patient has severe heart failure, then an \\nambulance will be sent to the patient and treatments will be started. This will provide the ratio of heart \\nfailure so that the clinicians can easily decide the type of treatment.  \\n \\nRajni Bhalla et al. [18] presents a novel ensemble -based machine learning mo del that combines \\nmultiple categorical datasets to enhance prediction accuracy. The proposed approach consists of three \\nmain components: dataset alignment, model training, and prediction aggregation. The dataset alignment \\nphase focuses on mapping categoric al variables across different datasets, ensuring consistency and \\ncompatibility. \\n \\nRajni Bhalla et al. [19] concludes by identifying the current research trends and challenges in \\nsentiment classification using hybrid ensemble -based approaches. It highlights the need for further \\ninvestigation into the combination of diverse classifiers and the integration of deep learning techniques \\nin ensemble frameworks.  The hybrid ensemble approach can be applied to classification dataset like \\nheart disease detection to achieve better accuracy. \\n \\nSivagowry S et al. [20] created a review of the application of data mining in heart disease prediction. \\nIn this, they have compared different data mining algorithms and concluded like heart disease prediction \\nwith data mining will become most successful with a smaller number of attributes, and text mining the \\nmedical data needs to be extended in predicting the health care data. \\n4. Methodology  \\n \\nFigure 3: Methodology \\n79 \\n \\nData collection is the first step. Data can be collected in two ways such as Online data and real-time \\ndata. Then we have to remove noise, missing values, useless values and all. This step is called data \\npreprocessing. Most of the online datasets are already preprocessed. So, we can directly use it without \\npreprocessing. But for real -time data, preprocessing can be done in different ways such as by using \\nmachine learning, deep learning or data mining methods. After this step we will get the data in usable \\nformat. Now, need to split the dataset into Training and Testing set. We can split the dataset in such a \\nway that 70% for training the model and 30% for testing. First train the model with train set. Then select \\nthe most significant feature for improving the prediction accuracy. Now, give test set to the model. It \\nwill predict accordingly. There are different evaluation metrics for checking the efficiency of the model \\nsuch as Precision, Recall, F1-score, confusion matrix and ROC curves etc. (Fig-3 depicts the same). \\n5. Results \\nThere are different regression and classification algorithms used to predict heart disease.  Different \\nmethods are used in different papers, and they have shown the accuracy that they obtained while using \\ndifferent methods. Table 1 shows the comparison of different works.

Introduction \\nCongestive heart failure is the main root of dysfunction in anatomy.  It is affected by the \\nreduction/blockage of coronary arteries. Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) is the most common  type of \\nCongestive heart failure. Common signs of Heart attack are Chest pain, body discomfort, and breath \\nshortness. Common symptoms of Arrhythmia are fluttering feelings in the chest or in common we can \\nquote it as “Palpitation.” Whereas common symptom of Heart failure is Breath shortness, Fatigue, or \\nswelling on the Leg, feet, ankles, neck veins, or even in the abdomen. Other than these there are other \\nmedical conditions and life cycles that can make people at high risk for heart disease like, Diabetes, \\nObesity, an Unbalanced diet, Physical incapacity or inactivity, and excessive usage of alcohol. \\n \\nThe current method of using an angiogram to identify heart disea ses has few risks to be overruled. \\nThey include allergic reactions to the dye used to see the coronary arteries, bleeding at the site  where \\nthe catheter is placed, and the usage of dye can even cause damage to the kidney. So, we recommend \\nthe usage of non-invasive methods. Predicting heart disease is extremely critical. Because one error in \\nprediction can lead to the death of the person. If a patient has diseases such as kidney failure or diabetes, \\nthen they must experience a higher risk after an angiogram. Some of such risks are: \\n \\n• May be allergic to anesthesia and contrast dye. \\n \\nCVMLH 2023: Workshop on Computer Vision and Machine Learning for Healthcare, May 20 – 21, 2023, Chennai, India. \\nEMAIL: sreekumari.sreelesh@gmail.com (Sreekumari S) \\nORCID: 0000-0002-0207-4738 (Sreekumari S) \\n \\n©️  2023 Copyright for this paper by its authors. \\nUse permitted under Creative Commons License Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0).  \\n \\nCEUR Workshop Proceedings (CEUR-WS.org) \\n \\nCEUR\\nWorkshop\\nProceedings\\nceur-ws.org\\nISSN 1613-007373 \\n \\n• Bleeding at the insertion point of the catheter. \\n• Blood clots or injury to an artery or vein. \\n \\nThese kinds of people must take contrast medicine before 24 hours to check whether they are allergic \\nor not.

All human beings do not possess higher pain tolerance. Those who are having low pain tolerance \\ncannot undergo an angiogram because of the high-risk factors. In such cases, we must use non-invasive \\nmethods to predict heart diseases. Heart diseases are of diverse types. They are: \\n \\n• Coronary Artery disease (CAD) \\n• Heart Arrhythmias \\n• Heart failure \\n• Heart valve disease \\n• Stroke etc. \\n \\nTo predict heart disease with the best accuracy prediction algorithm should be the  right one . \\nOtherwise, the prediction will go wrong which leads to the death of a person. Here, we have summarized \\nrecent activities in which we can find distinct predictive analytics. \\n \\nSince heart disease datasets are easily available online, data collection becomes remarkably simple. \\nThere is a lack of knowledge of data. That will be achieved after processing the data. This  should be \\nperformed by collecting the proper data after avoiding inappropriate data.  Then find out the missing \\ndata and remove all the duplicates. This step is called data preprocessing. After this split the dataset into \\ntwo such as the training set and testing set. Then apply different classification and regression algorithms \\nto predict whether a person has a chance of any heart  disease. From the accuracy, choose the best \\npredictive method. Fig-1 depicts the predictive method. \\n \\n \\nFigure 1: Predictive Model \\n2. Supervised Machine Learning Algorithms \\nIn supervised machine learning, training data is provided to the machine which works as a supervisor \\nthat teaches the machines to predict the output accurately. In this method, labeled  data is provided to \\ntrain the model and the model learns about distinct types of data. After the training process, the model \\nis evaluated based on test data which is a subset of the training set and then it starts predicting the output. \\nSupervised learning can again be divided into two. They are Regression and Classification. (Fig-2). The \\nfollowing are different machine learning   algorithms. \\n \\n74 \\n \\n. \\nFigure 2: Categories of Supervised Learning \\n2.1. Logistic Regression \\nIt is one of the most significant machine learning algorithms because it can provide probabilities and \\nclassify new data by using discrete and continuous datasets. The first step is to extract the dependent \\nand independent variables. Then splitting of the dataset and feature scaling is performed. The outcome \\nmust be of a categorical or discrete value. \\n2.2. K- nearest neighbor algorithm \\nThis supervised learning algorithm stores all the given data and based on the similarity it classifies \\na new data point. It is also known as the “Lazy- Learner Algorithm.” Because it acts on the dataset \\nduring classification instead of learning from the training dataset. It can be used for both Regression \\nand Classification. But typically used for Classification problems. It will be more effective if the training \\ndata is large. \\n2.3. Support Vector Machine \\nThis is a well-liked supervised learning algorithm. In this plot, each data is a point in n- dimension \\nspace with each value of feature being a particular  coordinate value. Then classification is performed \\nafter finding the hyper-plane which is also known as the best decision boundary. \\n2.4. Artificial Neural Network \\nIt is a special type of machine-learning algorithm that is used  to model the human brain. ANN is \\ncapable of learning from the data, and it provides results as classification or prediction such as neurons \\nin our nervous system  learning from past data. ANNs are non -linear statistical models that show \\ncomplex relationships between inputs and outputs. The three important layers are the input layer, hidden \\nlayers, and output layer. The hidden layer may be single or multiple. In this model, different parameters \\naffect the performance of the model. The output is dependent on this data. The input layer communicates \\nwith the hidden layer and the activated neurons will continue passing until it reaches the output layer. \\n2.5. Decision Trees \\nIt is a type of supervised machine learning algorithm, in which the data set is always split based on \\na defined constraint. Decision nodes and leaves are the two results that can be derived from the decision \\ntree. \\n75 \\n \\n2.6. Random Forest Classification (RFC):  \\nRFC is based on the concept of combo learning, which means a process of solving a complex \\nproblem to an improved and more accurate level of performance of the model by combining the \\nmultiple classifiers. \\n \\nSince this rev iew paper is about machine learning techniques, we have gone through different \\nmachine learning algorithms.'),\n",

There are ample methods used in heart disease prediction  other than \\nmachine learning. They are deep learning, Data mining, IoT tools, etc. \\n3. Literature Review \\n \\nE. K. Oikonomou et al.  [1], they have given a clear idea about Artificial intelligence,  Machine \\nlearning, big data, and different prediction methods like supervised and unsupervised  methods. CT \\n(Cardiac Computed Tomography) imaging is the best way to predict  Cardio Artery Disease (CAD), \\nwhich will mitigate the complexity of doctors to predict CAD by using images, and it will be helpful \\nfor the patients to identify the disease faster.  Predictions are performed using Regression analysis and \\nClassification methods. Regression analysis is performed on the image using  a deep neural network \\n(DNN) algorithm or Support vector machines or decision trees. They have given a good explanation of \\nRadiomics. For image processing, detection, and segmentation they have used CCTA (Coronary CT \\nAngiography) scans and Machine Learning (ML) Algorithms. They stated that it can predict many risks \\nwhich are not possible with humans. They concluded by explaining the limitations and stating that this \\nwork has offered a lot to the patients as well as doctors. \\n \\nLi Bin et al. [2] tried to establish a disease pre-alert model within the 3 Year gap for hypertension \\npatients. To achieve public data analysis through AI technologies  they have used spark data analysis \\nfor hypertension patients. Using data mining, unbalanced data is converted to usable form using the Z-\\nscore standard. Stroke, Heart failure, and Renal Failure symptoms viz. 3 group predictions ascertain the \\npre-alert risk warning using a data mining algorithm. AI technologies used in this model are Logistic \\nRegression ( LR), Support  Vector Machine (SVM), and Naive Bayes Algorithm ( NB). For feature \\nselection, they have used the Chi-Square test. In this, they have used three types of datasets. They are \\nStroke, Heart failure, and Renal Failure. But they perform classification on two datasets viz. Stroke and \\nHeart failure. The algorithms used were Naïve Bayes, SVM , and Logistic regression. The stroke data \\nset shows an accuracy of more than .75, while classification results on the heart failure dataset show an \\naccuracy of more than .85. Logistic regression is superior to Naïve Bayes and SVM. They have shown \\nthe Receiver Operating Characteristic curve as well (ROC). They have used SVM -RFE for feature \\nselection, which is not suitable for choosing the most suitable feature subset. For getting better results \\nneed to use a different algorithm for comparing and analyzing in the next research because SVM-RFE \\ncannot evaluate various feature selection algorithms. \\n \\nS Manish et al. [3] they have given a brief description of the technologies used for the study. They \\nhave stated that this is the first paper that uses Optimally Time-Frequency Concentrated (OTFC) even-\\nlength biorthogonal wavelet filter bank (BWFB) for automatically detecting CAD. The Fuzzy Entropy \\n(FE) and log Energy (LogE) features were extracted from various subbands of the filter. They used Raw \\nECG data from twenty males and twenty females and CAD ECG from Six females and one male. Then \\nsignals were classified using Gaussian Support Machine Classifier (GSVM). They have stated that this \\nstudy shows high accuracy compared with other methods and while others are using thirty features for \\nclassification, they use only twelve features. \\n \\nA Moloud et al.  [4] proposed a data mining method for CAD analysis.  Data manipulation and \\nnormalization were performed first. Then they selected features using GA and PSO algorithms. 10-fold \\ncross-validation was performed on subsets. For classification purposes in the prelims test, they used ten 76 \\n \\nalgorithms. Among them, the best three SVM classifiers were selected for the final. They are nu-SVC, \\nnu-SVM, and Linear SVM. To optimize data, they used two optimization methods. Then they generated \\na confusion matrix for evaluating results. They have selected fitness functions. It has shown an accuracy \\nof 93.08% based on the confusion matrix. They concluded by saying that instead of normalization other \\npreprocessing approaches should be used in the future. \\n \\nR Silvia et al'),\n",

[5] The objective of this review article is to describe the contemporary state of artificial \\nintelligence in clinical practice. In this paper, they have explained very well about Artificial Intelligence \\nand different subfields of Artificial intelligence like Machine learning, and deep learning and their \\nsubfields. They have given proper descriptions of new emerging  communication and information \\ntechnologies like Mobile health and IOT. These are subfields  of E-health. And explained applications \\nin cardiovascular imaging as well. Echocardiography, Magnetic resonance Imaging, Cardiac computed \\ntomography, and Electrocardiography are different applications in Cardiovascular Imaging. \\n \\nJohnson et al. [6] have done a study about how AI and ML relate to statistics and why cardiology \\nneeds AI. They have explained in detail how to choose the best algorithm for feature selection. Through \\nthis paper , we can easily understand  different supervised Machine Learning algorithms used in \\nCardiovascular disease prediction like Logistic Regression, Regularized Regression, Tree-Based \\nmethods, Bootstrap, and Support Vector Machine. For explaining these they have given proper \\nexamples. In Unsupervised Machine learning, they have given a brief description of Neural networks \\nand Deep Learning methods. The two most common forms of DL are CNN and RNN and explained the \\nmajor disadvantage of deep learning. They have concluded by stating to use this study as a decision tool \\nfor medical practitioners. \\n \\nAcharya et al. [7] explained invasive and non-invasive techniques used in CAD detection. They have \\nused Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) Classifier for this purpose. Non-linear parameters are extracted \\nfrom echocardiography images. They have taken four hundred normal images of thirty normal subjects \\nand Four hundred CAD images of  thirty affected subjects. They have noticed the ischemic changes. \\nTwelve lead electrocardiogram images were checked for wall motion abnormality. The training set and \\ntest set are there. An expert physician can mark the image collected as belonging to a normal or CAD-\\naffected person. Then different classifiers are used to extract the features. A total of 559 features are \\nextracted from each  image. T -test was used for statisti cal analysis. If p<.01 or.05, the feature is \\nmeasured as very perceptive. A three-fold stratified cross-validation technique is used for developing \\nand testing the classifiers. In this , they have used six classifiers. They are DT, FS, GMM, RBPNN, \\nKNN, and NBC. Then the heart index is calculated which is a combination of nine distinctive features. \\nThe heat index for normal is 2.52± 0.07 and for CAD 2.86± 0.11.  They have stated that this can be \\ntransformed into software, can be implemented on any device,  and concluded that this shows  100% \\naccuracy. \\n \\nS E Golovenkin et al. [8] tried to improve prediction by using the voting method of three competing \\nsystems and by eliminating sparse data columns. In this study,  the prediction was performed using \\nMatlab2016 System, the Neural Network Toolbox module. In Artificial Neural Network, there was one \\ninput layer and two hidden layers. All layers are interconnected, and the output layer predicts the results. \\nThe voting method is used in this. The “Sliding- Window” method was used to increase the efficiency \\nof the learning process. Standard indicators  are Accuracy, Sensitivity , and specificity. They ha ve \\neliminated sparse set input data columns.  They have also stated that the use of 3 Neural Networks \\nincreases accuracy by 1.2%. \\n \\nBabaoglu et al.  [9] used Principle Component Analysis (PCA) which is a   method of identifying \\npatterns in data  and expressing them by highlighting differences and  similarities. They have taken a \\ndataset of 480 patients after excluding patients with some problems. They have used a Support Vector \\nMachine for classification and regression tasks.  The assessments are implem ented in Matlab 7.0 \\napplication using the LIBSVM package. The SVM method for twenty-three features shows less \\naccuracy. So, using the PCA method, features were reduced to eighteen. Then it shows an accuracy of \\n79.17%. They have concluded by stating that, P CA reduced dataset'),\n",

[10] tried to provide the recent adaptive image -based classification techniques. \\nThey have explained diverse types of heart diseases. They have compared the prediction methods used \\nin different studies. The first step is image registration which can be performed on a raw image database \\nand de-noising processing should be done. The feature is extracted from the image. They have used two \\ndifferent training models. They are Naive - Bayes Classification and SVM. They have concluded by \\nstating that SVM is more accurate than Naïve Bayes Classification. The database needs to be updated \\nwith more descriptions of patients. \\n \\nM M Ali et al. [11] used the Kaggle dataset. They have done a comparison study and developed their \\nexperimental model. They have applied six classification algorithms to compare the accuracy of the \\nbest performer and statistical variables by using a ten-fold cross-validation method. The six classifiers \\nwere KNN, Random Forest, Decision Tree, AdaboostM1(ABM1), Logistic Regression, and Multilayer \\nPerception (MLP). They have  listed the five most crucial features based on feature importance and \\ncorrelation value. In this study compared to other classifiers RF shows 100% accuracy. KNN and MLP \\nfailed to generate feature importance scores or coefficient values. But this method has one limitation,  \\nthis data model is not enough to address all the issues. \\n \\nYazdani A et al.  [12] used WARM (Weighted Associative Rule Mining) to predict  heart disease. \\nThey have compared the efficiency of earlier models that used the WARM method to predict heart \\ndisease. In this model , weights are assigned to identify the  best features mined. Feature values are \\nevaluated. For Eg: Feature values for sex are Male and Female. After that calculate the total weight for \\nthe feature. Then applied WARM using the Apriori algorithm. Of thirteen features, eight significant \\nfeatures were identified. Finally, the confidence score is generated. This model shows a 98% confidence \\nscore which is better than the earlier studies. \\n \\nSumit S et al. [ 13] proposed this study to create a deep learning neural network  heart disease \\nprediction model by using a new optimization technique called Talos Hyperparameter. They have used \\nUCI Heart Disease Dataset. They applied different learning algorithms like Logistic regression, KNN, \\nSVM, Naïve Bayes, and Hyperparameter optimization (Talos). Talos follows POD (Prepare, Optimize, \\nand Deploy) process workflow. Reporting and evaluation are the last process after POD. Talos method \\nshows an accuracy of 90.78% which is better compared to other learning methods. \\n     \\nBharati R et al. [14] conducted this study to compare the performance of both Machine learning as \\nwell as deep learning methods. They have considered a public dataset. In this , they compared both \\nmachine learning as well as deep learning methods.  In pre-processing the data, checked the distribution \\nof data, skewness of data, stats of normal distribution data, feature selection , and checking for \\nduplicates. after that proposed machine learning classifiers as well as deep learning classifiers. Then \\nthey evaluated the process and concluded by stating that dataset size need s to be increased and more \\noptimization and normalization techniques need to be used. \\n \\nIshaq A et al. [15] conducted this study for comparing different machine learning techniques to select \\nthe most suitable method for heart disease survival prediction. The dataset used was UCI Repository. \\nThen applied RF to employ feature ranking. Classified the data into training and testing sets. They \\napplied one oversampling method called SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) to deal \\nwith imbalanced data in medicine.

They \\napplied one oversampling method called SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) to deal \\nwith imbalanced data in medicine. Performance evaluation matrices were Accuracy, Precision, Recall, \\nand F-Score.  Among 9 classifiers, they got more accuracy for RF, and it was .8889. With SMOTE, it \\nshows 10% more accuracy.

[16] presents a detailed examination of the effectiveness and performance of both \\nproposed and existing methodologies for classification task. The study aims to compare and evaluate \\nthe advantages and limitations of different methodologies for collectin g and analyzing data for 78 \\n \\nstructured data. By conducting a comparative analysis, the paper provides valuable insights for \\nresearchers and practitioners seeking to optimize their methodologies for classification tasks and for \\ndata that is in a structured format. \\n \\nAbdel-Basset M et al. [17] proposed this study to develop an IoT model to detect and monitor heart \\nfailure-infected patients. Achieved from various wearable sensors. They used WBAN or medical sensor \\nnodes. The data extracted from WBAN convey are sent to the mobile application through Bluetooth or \\nZigBee and stored in the cloud server to store, process , and broadcast data. Then N- MCDM model is \\nused to determine the percentage of heart failure disease. If the patient has severe heart failure, then an \\nambulance will be sent to the patient and treatments will be started. This will provide the ratio of heart \\nfailure so that the clinicians can easily decide the type of treatment.  \\n \\nRajni Bhalla et al. [18] presents a novel ensemble -based machine learning mo del that combines \\nmultiple categorical datasets to enhance prediction accuracy. The proposed approach consists of three \\nmain components: dataset alignment, model training, and prediction aggregation. The dataset alignment \\nphase focuses on mapping categoric al variables across different datasets, ensuring consistency and \\ncompatibility. \\n \\nRajni Bhalla et al. [19] concludes by identifying the current research trends and challenges in \\nsentiment classification using hybrid ensemble -based approaches. It highlights the need for further \\ninvestigation into the combination of diverse classifiers and the integration of deep learning techniques \\nin ensemble frameworks.  The hybrid ensemble approach can be applied to classification dataset like \\nheart disease detection to achieve better accuracy. \\n \\nSivagowry S et al. [20] created a review of the application of data mining in heart disease prediction. \\nIn this, they have compared different data mining algorithms and concluded like heart disease prediction \\nwith data mining will become most successful with a smaller number of attributes, and text mining the \\nmedical data needs to be extended in predicting the health care data. \\n4. Methodology  \\n \\nFigure 3: Methodology \\n79 \\n \\nData collection is the first step. Data can be collected in two ways such as Online data and real-time \\ndata. Then we have to remove noise, missing values, useless values and all. This step is called data \\npreprocessing. Most of the online datasets are already preprocessed. So, we can directly use it without \\npreprocessing. But for real -time data, preprocessing can be done in different ways such as by using \\nmachine learning, deep learning or data mining methods. After this step we will get the data in usable \\nformat. Now, need to split the dataset into Training and Testing set. We can split the dataset in such a \\nway that 70% for training the model and 30% for testing. First train the model with train set. Then select \\nthe most significant feature for improving the prediction accuracy. Now, give test set to the model. It \\nwill predict accordingly. There are different evaluation metrics for checking the efficiency of the model \\nsuch as Precision, Recall, F1-score, confusion matrix and ROC curves etc. (Fig-3 depicts the same). \\n5. Results \\nThere are different regression and classification algorithms used to predict heart disease.  Different \\nmethods are used in different papers, and they have shown the accuracy that they obtained while using \\ndifferent methods. Table 1 shows the comparison of different works. In most of the papers, the different \\nalgorithms used are Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, ANN, SVM, DT, RF, etc. Among them, ANN \\nand RF show more accuracy. \\n \\nTable 1: Comparison of previous works \\nReference Methodology Dataset Accuracy \\n[1] Support Vector Machine 42 CCTA Sensitivity- 93% \\nSpecificity-95% \\n[2] Naive Bayes SVM (Linear) \\nLogistic Regression \\nStroke Dataset 5257 Heart \\nfailure Dataset 714 \\nOn Stroke Dataset'),\n",
