"10. Can you walk us through the development of the house price prediction model and the real-time detection models for helmets, number plates, and industrial safety gear? How were these models deployed for real-time use in various scenarios?","I can provide information on the development of the house price prediction model and the real-time detection models for helmets, number plates, and industrial safety gear.

1. **House Price Prediction Model:**
   - **Development:** The house price prediction model was developed using machine learning techniques, likely regression algorithms, to predict house prices based on various features like location, size, amenities, etc.
   - **Deployment:** The model was deployed in a GCP Docker container for real-time use. This deployment method allows the model to be accessed and utilized in real-time scenarios.

2. **Real-Time Detection Models:**
   - **Helmets and Number Plates Detection:**
     - **Development:** YOLOv8 was used to create a model for real-time detection of helmets and number plates from live video feeds. YOLO (You Only Look Once) is a popular object detection algorithm known for its speed and accuracy.
     - **Deployment:** The model was deployed in a way that allows it to process live video feeds and detect helmets and number plates in real-time, likely using a combination of hardware acceleration and optimized software.

   - **Industrial Safety Gear Detection:**
     - **Development:** Another YOLOv8 model was created specifically for detecting industrial safety gear in real-time. This model would have been trained on images of various safety gear items to accurately detect them.
     - **Deployment:** Similar to the helmets and number plates model, the industrial safety gear detection model would have been deployed to process live video feeds and provide real-time detection of safety gear in industrial settings.

Unfortunately, the specific details of how these models were deployed for real-time use in various scenarios are not provided in the context. For more detailed information on the deployment process, it would be best to refer to the respective GitHub repositories or reach out to the developer directly."
